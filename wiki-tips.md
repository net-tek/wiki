# Blockquotes
## What is a blockquote
A blockquote is originally used to define a section that is quoted from another source. However, Wiki.js offers many additional options to the blockquote.

## How to define a blockquote
Simply begin your line of text with a **>**

For example, the following markdown text:


```text
> A line of text

> A blockquote with
> 
> multiple lines  
> of text!

> You can even include **styling** in your text, or **icons** :apple:
```

would result in:

> A line of text

> A blockquote with
> 
> multiple lines  
> of text!

> You can even include **styling** in your text, or **icons** :apple:

## Available styling

Various styling options are available:

>Default

>Info
{.is-info}

>Success
{.is-success}

>Warning
{.is-warning}

>Danger
{.is-danger}

Simply add the desired styling class below your blockquote:


```text
> Default

> Info
{.is-info}

> Success
{.is-success}

> Warning
{.is-warning}

> Danger
{.is-danger}
```
