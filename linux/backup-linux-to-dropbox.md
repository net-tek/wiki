# Using Linux and Dropbox as a remote backup solution
How to create a free remote backup solution using Linux and Dropbox.
In my previous post I wrote about how to backup websites and databases using the command line in Linux.
In this post I am going to show how to extend this setup with Dropbox to make it a full fledged remote backup solution and it's free! (at least for the first 2 GB )

## Obtaining an account from Dropbox
You might want to create a Dropbox account only for taking backups if you don&#8217;t want all your documents and photos synchronized to your Linux server.
Go to www.dropbox.com to create your account.
