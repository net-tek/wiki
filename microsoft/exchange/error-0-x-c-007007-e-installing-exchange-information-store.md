Checking another source, I think that might actually mean something is missing. You need to install the Windows Support Tools, then use the dependency checker to see what it missing. Depending on what files are missing will depend on what the fix is and whether it is easy or not.

I give you the biggest pat on the back ever!!! Your a Freakin Genius! I have been on this issue since 5 o'clock yesterday and you come along with one suggestion and BAM! Problem solved. Now lets see if the email's will start to flow. The only thing I had to do outside your suggestion was to reregister Atl.dll for it to reregister drviis.dll. I found this article when i got the first error when reregistering drviis.dll:

http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=888177 

How in the world did you know the exact dll file? Well however you knew, I am extremely gratefull. You just saved me from paying MS $245. And maybe even a lawsuit =) J/K. They wouldn't do that. They are good people.

I'll keep you posted on final results if you would like. Thanks again Simon.
