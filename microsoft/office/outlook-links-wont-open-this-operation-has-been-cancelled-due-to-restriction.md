Registry fix 

If resetting via the conventional means does not work out for you, then the issue is probably rooted a bit deeper and are the file associations and handlers not correctly registered in the registry or are conflicting.
 
This zip-file contains 3 files;
 * readme.txt                                      Some information over the zip-file itself
 * ie-fix-restrictions-Win32.reg           For when using a 32-bit version of Windows
 * ie-fix-restrictions-Win64.reg           For when using a 64-bit version of Windows 

This registry file contains the minimal amount or registry entries needed for making Internet links open again with Internet Explorer. All these registry entries are original entries which are also there when you do a clean installation of Windows. 
If found, it also removes some registry entries which could conflict with the original entries. These registry entries also do not exist when doing a clean installation of Windows.
 
Note 1: For importing this registry file you’ll need to have Administrator rights on the computer.
 
Note 2: The registry keys are based on a default installation of Windows on the C:\-drive. If you installed Windows to another drive letter or if you want to see what’s inside the reg-file before importing it, you can extract the zip-file and then open/edit it in Notepad by right clicking on the reg-file and choosing Edit.
